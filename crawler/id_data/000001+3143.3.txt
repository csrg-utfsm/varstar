# ################   DESCRIPTION   ###############
# The ASAS Photometric Catalog is maintained separately for each
# observed field, so for some stars independent 'datasets' of
# measurements are available. Their mean magnitudes may slightly differ.
#
# In each 'dataset' (starting with #dataset=0,1,2,...):
# 'desig' is ASAS designation (they may differ (by 1) at the last
# digit of the RA & DEC fields
# 'cra', 'cdec' are initial Catalog coordinates
# 'ndata' is number of points in each dataset
# 'cmag_*',  'cmer_*' are reference magnitude & dispersion for each aperture
# 'nskip_*' is number of data points skipped when calculating 'cmag' & 'cmer'
# 'ra', 'dec', 'mag', 'mer' are coordinates, magnitude and dispersion
# calculated directly from the data
#
# Each data row consists of the following fields:
# -  HJD-2450000
# -  magnitudes (one for each aperture)
# -  frame errors describing average photometric quality of the frame (for each aperture)
# -  frame number
# -  grade :
#    A - best data, no 29.999 (not measured) indication
#    B - mean data, no 29.999 (not measured) indication
#    C - A and B with 29.999 (not measured) indication
#    D - worst data, probably useless
